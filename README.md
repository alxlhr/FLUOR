# FLUOR
Underwater ray tracing code developed in Python during my internship

How to run :

Edit the user.py file to your needs, and run it.


Capacities : 
- 1D and 2D sound speed fields
- Transmission Loss
- Arrival calculations

Problems :
- Bad user interface
- Overestimation of the direct ray
- No losses at the boundaries
